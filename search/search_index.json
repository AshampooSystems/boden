THE FRONT PAGE SOURCE IS IN themes/hero.html! PLEASE DO NOT DELETE THIS FILE. WE KEEP IT FOR REFERENCE AND TO GENERATE SYNTAX HIGHLIGHTED SOURCE BLOCKS. Build real native mobile apps using modern C++17 and Boden \u00b6 Write your mobile apps in modern C++17 and compile 100% native Android and iOS apps from a single statically typed codebase. No need for scripting. No overhead introduced by virtual machines. Using Boden is straight forward: // MainViewController.cpp #include <bdn/ui.h> #include <bdn/ui/yoga.h> #include \"MainViewController.h\" using namespace bdn ; using namespace bdn :: ui ; MainViewController :: MainViewController () { _window = std :: make_shared < Window > (); _window -> title = \"AwesomeApp\" ; _window -> geometry = Rect { 0 , 0 , 400 , 300 }; _window -> setLayout ( std :: make_shared < yoga :: Layout > ()); auto button = std :: make_shared < Button > (); button -> label = \"Hello World\" ; _window -> contentView = button ; _window -> visible = true ; } Harness the power of native widgets and native user interface behavior \u00b6 Boden wraps the native user interface controls provided by the platform. This is done consistently, down to the level of a list item in a native list control. In doing so, Boden lets you create apps as if you had used the native platform framework. And users won't recognize any difference to the behavior they are already used to. Lay out your user interface with Flex layouts \u00b6 With Boden laying out your UI is a breeze. Just define your layouts using Flex stylesheets directly in C++. Boden uses the Yoga layout engine accross all platforms. // MainViewController.cpp #include <bdn/ui.h> #include <bdn/ui/yoga.h> #include \"MainViewController.h\" using namespace bdn ; using namespace bdn :: ui ; MainViewController :: MainViewController () { _window = std :: make_shared < Window > (); _window -> title = \"AwesomeApp\" ; _window -> geometry = Rect { 0 , 0 , 400 , 300 }; _window -> setLayout ( std :: make_shared < yoga :: Layout > ()); _window -> stylesheet = FlexJsonStringify ({ \"justifyContent\" : \"Center\" , \"alignItems\" : \"Center\" }); std :: shared_ptr < Button > button = std :: make_shared < Button > (); button -> label = \"Hello World\" ; _window -> contentView = button ; _window -> visible = true ; } Reuse your existing programming skills \u00b6 Boden builds upon well-established technologies and best practices where possible. A Boden string literally is an std::string . No custom containers, smart pointers, or other basic concepts. This allows you to reuse your existing knowledge and focus on what's most important: your app. Enjoy the modern lightweight approach to building cross-platform apps \u00b6 Boden doesn't come with 20 gigabytes of bloat and it doesn't require you to go through a lengthy installation process. A simple git clone command and an integrated development environment most likely already installed on your machine is enough to get started.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#build-real-native-mobile-apps-using-modern-c17-and-boden","text":"Write your mobile apps in modern C++17 and compile 100% native Android and iOS apps from a single statically typed codebase.

Desktop platforms will be supported in the future, but we cannot nail down a date yet. On which platforms can I develop apps based on Boden? \u00b6 On macOS, Linux, and Windows. To compile, run, and deploy iOS apps, you will need a Mac. What IDEs are supported? \u00b6 Xcode on macOS, Android Studio on Linux and Windows. Other workflows are possible, but we don't advertise them actively as they have not yet been thoroughly tested. How does licensing work? \u00b6 Boden is an open-source project licensed under the (Lesser) GNU General Public License. You may license Boden either under the GPL (version 2 or 3) or LGPL (version 2.1 or 3). Please refer to our Licensing section for details. If you cannot or do not want to comply with the (L)GPL terms, please contact us to learn more about our commercial/proprietary licensing options. Where can I get support? \u00b6 We recommend joining the Boden Google Group . We read every post in the group and will do our best to respond to questions quickly. I found an issue. What should I do? \u00b6 Please open an issue on GitHub and tell us about it. Can I already build a production app with Boden? \u00b6 Most likely not yet. But we're ramping up quickly, so this might change within the next weeks and months. We aim for a Boden 1.0 release by Q1/2020 and it will most likely be possible to create a producion app earlier. Are desktop platforms supported? \u00b6 Not yet. But eventually they will be supported. See below. Do you plan to support desktop platforms in the future? \u00b6 Yes. Most likely we will support macOS and Windows UWP in the future, but we don't yet know exactly when desktop support will land in Boden. Hint: There's unofficial macOS support already, but we don't talk about that as it's not going to be stable soon and is intended for internal testing purposes only at the moment. Is Boden a Commercial Project? \u00b6 Yes. While Boden is free and open source, it is commercially developed by a full-time team. Our goal is to make sophisticated app development hassle-free for you and we believe there is no better way of ensuring the necessary resources are fully committed to the framework. Didn't find the question you were looking for? \u00b6 Please let us know .

There are two classes, Object and JTObject . JTObject is a convenience class that uses templates to make creating new wrapper simpler. First Steps \u00b6 In this example we show the simplest way to wrap a java class: constexpr const char kMyJavaClassName [] = \"io/mycompany/MyJavaClass\" ; using MyJavaClass = bdn :: java :: wrapper :: JTObject < kMyJavaClassName > ; With these definitions you can now instantiate a Java class from C++ in your code: MyJavaClass myClass ; This will automatically instantiate the Java class for you. Wrapping Java Class Methods \u00b6 To be able to add methods to your wrapper class, add the following to the previous example code: constexpr const char kMyJavaClassName [] = \"io/mycompany/MyJavaClass\" ; class MyJavaClass : public bdn :: java :: wrapper :: JTObject < kMyJavaClassName > { public : using bdn :: java :: wrapper :: JTObject < kMyJavaClassName >:: JTObject ; }; Now that you have your class ready, you can start to add methods to it. Boden provides the convenience class JavaMethod to simplify the process. constexpr const char kMyJavaClassName [] = \"io/mycompany/MyJavaClass\" ; class MyJavaClass : public bdn :: java :: wrapper :: JTObject < kMyJavaClassName > { public : using bdn :: java :: wrapper :: JTObject < kMyJavaClassName >:: JTObject ; public : bdn :: JavaMethod < void ( bdn :: JavaString ) > testFunction { this , \"testFunction\" }; }; JavaMethod itself is a template that takes a function pointer style argument. It needs to be initialized with a pointer to the object ( this ) and the name of the function has be be provided as a string (in this case testFunction ). Now you can call the function: MyJavaClass myClass ; myClass . testFunction ( \"Hello World\" ); Deriving from JTObject Base Classes \u00b6 To derive from a class, you pass through the new class name as a template argument. Building on the previous example you change MyJavaClass to the following (changes are highlighted below): constexpr const char kMyJavaClassName [] = \"io/mycompany/MyJavaClass\" ; template < const char * javaClassName = kMyJavaClassName > class BaseMyJavaClass : public bdn :: java :: wrapper :: JTObject < javaClassName > { public : using bdn :: java :: wrapper :: JTObject < javaClassName >:: JTObject ; public : bdn :: JavaMethod < void ( bdn :: JavaString ) > testFunction { this , \"testFunction\" }; }; using MyJavaClass = BaseMyJavaClass <> ; In the first highlighted line you change MyJavaClass to be a template class taking a const char* so you can override the Java class name. For convenience, we set the original name as a default argument. In the second line you change the class name to BaseMyJavaClass . This again is for convenience. In the end we create a using declaration so our code can continue to use MyJavaClass as a class name. Now, just as before, you can create a new class that derives from BaseMyJavaClass : constexpr const char kDerivedJavaClassName [] = \"io/mycompany/DervivedJavaClass\" ; class DerivedJavaClass : public BaseMyJavaClass < kDerivedJavaClassName > { public : using BaseMyJavaClass < kDerivedJavaClassName >:: BaseMyJavaClass ; }; You can now instantiate the derived class. You do not need to redefine methods in the derived class if your Java class overloads them. They will work automatically as long as they are defined in the base class.

Now you can call the function: MyJavaClass myClass ; myClass . testFunction ( \"Hello World\" );","title":"Wrapping Java Class Methods"},{"location":"guides/extending/wrap_java_class/#deriving-from-jtobject-base-classes","text":"To derive from a class, you pass through the new class name as a template argument.

In the end we create a using declaration so our code can continue to use MyJavaClass as a class name.

As an example, add a label property so users of your view can set the button's label. class ExampleButtonView : public ui :: View { public : Property < std :: string > label ; } ExampleButtonView.h #pragma once #include <bdn/ui/View.h> namespace bdn { namespace detail { VIEW_CORE_REGISTRY_DECLARATION ( ExampleButtonView ) } class ExampleButtonView : public ui :: View { public : Property < std :: string > label ; public : ExampleButtonView ( std :: shared_ptr < ViewCoreFactory > viewCoreFactory = nullptr ); public : class Core { }; }; } To connect the property to the core, replicate the property in the Core interface: class Core { public : Property < std :: string > label ; } ExampleButtonView.h #pragma once #include <bdn/ui/View.h> namespace bdn { namespace detail { VIEW_CORE_REGISTRY_DECLARATION ( ExampleButtonView ) } class ExampleButtonView : public ui :: View { public : Property < std :: string > label ; public : ExampleButtonView ( std :: shared_ptr < ViewCoreFactory > viewCoreFactory = nullptr ); public : class Core { public : Property < std :: string > label ; }; }; } To bind the two label properties in View and Core properties, override the View::bindViewCore() function: void ExampleButtonView :: bindViewCore () { View :: bindViewCore (); auto buttonCore = core < ExampleButtonView :: Core > (); buttonCore -> label . bind ( label ); } ExampleButtonView.cpp #include <bdn/ExampleButtonView.h> namespace bdn { namespace detail { VIEW_CORE_REGISTRY_IMPLEMENTATION ( ExampleButtonView ) } ExampleButtonView :: ExampleButtonView ( std :: shared_ptr < ViewCoreFactory > viewCoreFactory ) : View ( viewCoreFactory ) { bdn :: detail :: VIEW_CORE_REGISTER ( ExampleButtonView , View :: viewCoreFactory ()); } void ExampleButtonView :: bindViewCore () { View :: bindViewCore (); auto buttonCore = core < ExampleButtonView :: Core > (); buttonCore -> label . bind ( label ); } } Now it is easy to react to changes to label in the iOS Implementation by adding an onChange() handler in the view core's init function. namespace bdn :: ios { void ExampleButtonViewCore :: init () { ViewCore :: init (); label . onChange () += [ = ]( auto newValue ) { auto uiButton = ( UIButton * ) uiView (); [ uiButton setTitle : bdn :: fk :: stringToNSString ( value ) forState : UIControlStateNormal ]]; }; } } ExampleButtonViewCore.mm #import <bdn/ios/ExampleButtonViewCore.hh> #import <bdn/foundationkit/stringUtil.hh> @interface ExampleUIButton : UIButton < UIViewWithFrameNotification > @property ( nonatomic , assign ) std :: weak_ptr < bdn :: ios :: ExampleButtonViewCore > core ; @end @implementation ExampleUIButton - ( void ) setViewCore: ( std :: weak_ptr < bdn :: ios :: ViewCore > ) viewCore { self . core = std :: dynamic_pointer_cast < bdn :: ios :: ExampleButtonViewCore > ( viewCore . lock ()); } - ( void ) setFrame: ( CGRect ) frame { [ super setFrame : frame ]; if ( auto core = self . core . lock ()) { core -> frameChanged (); } } @end namespace bdn :: detail { CORE_REGISTER ( ExampleButtonView , bdn :: ios :: ExampleButtonViewCore , ExampleButtonView ) } namespace bdn :: ios { ExampleButtonViewCore :: ExampleButtonViewCore ( const std :: shared_ptr < bdn :: ViewCoreFactory > & viewCoreFactory ) : ViewCore ( viewCoreFactory , [ ExampleUIButton buttonWithType : UIButtonTypeSystem ]) { } ExampleButtonViewCore ::~ ExampleButtonViewCore () { } void ExampleButtonViewCore :: init () { ViewCore :: init (); label . onChange () += [ = ]( auto newValue ) { auto uiButton = ( UIButton * ) uiView (); [ uiButton setTitle : bdn :: fk :: stringToNSString ( value ) forState : UIControlStateNormal ]]; }; } } Sending Notifications to the View \u00b6 To allow users of your new class to react to button clicks, you can use a combination of a Notifier and a WeakCallback . First, add the WeakCallback to your Core: class ExampleButtonView : public ui :: View { public : class Core { public : WeakCallback < void () > _clickCallback ; } } ExampleButtonView.h #pragma once #include <bdn/ui/View.h> namespace bdn { namespace detail { VIEW_CORE_REGISTRY_DECLARATION ( ExampleButtonView ) } class ExampleButtonView : public ui :: View { public : Property < std :: string > label ; public : ExampleButtonView ( std :: shared_ptr < ViewCoreFactory > viewCoreFactory = nullptr ); public : class Core { public : Property < std :: string > label ; public : WeakCallback < void () > _clickCallback ; }; }; } Now you can fire the callback from your UIButton subclass: - ( void ) clicked { if ( auto core = self . core . lock ()) { core -> _clickCallback . fire (); } } ExampleButtonViewCore.mm #import <bdn/ios/ExampleButtonViewCore.hh> #import <bdn/foundationkit/stringUtil.hh> @interface ExampleUIButton : UIButton < UIViewWithFrameNotification > @property ( nonatomic , assign ) std :: weak_ptr < bdn :: ios :: ExampleButtonViewCore > core ; @end @implementation ExampleUIButton - ( void ) setViewCore: ( std :: weak_ptr < bdn :: ios :: ViewCore > ) viewCore { self . core = std :: dynamic_pointer_cast < bdn :: ios :: ExampleButtonViewCore > ( viewCore . lock ()); } - ( void ) setFrame: ( CGRect ) frame { [ super setFrame : frame ]; if ( auto core = self . core . lock ()) { core -> frameChanged (); } } - ( void ) clicked { if ( auto core = self . core . lock ()) { core -> _clickCallback . fire (); } } @end namespace bdn :: detail { CORE_REGISTER ( ExampleButtonView , bdn :: ios :: ExampleButtonViewCore , ExampleButtonView ) } namespace bdn :: ios { ExampleButtonViewCore :: ExampleButtonViewCore ( const std :: shared_ptr < bdn :: ViewCoreFactory > & viewCoreFactory ) : ViewCore ( viewCoreFactory , [ ExampleUIButton buttonWithType : UIButtonTypeSystem ]) { } ExampleButtonViewCore ::~ ExampleButtonViewCore () { } void ExampleButtonViewCore :: init () { ViewCore :: init (); label . onChange () += [ = ]( auto newValue ) { auto uiButton = ( UIButton * ) uiView (); [ uiButton setTitle : bdn :: fk :: stringToNSString ( value ) forState : UIControlStateNormal ]]; }; } } Add the notifier and the callback receiver to your View class: class ExampleButtonView { public : Notifier < const ClickEvent &> _onClick ; WeakCallback < void () >:: Receiver _clickCallbackReceiver ; } ExampleButtonView.h #pragma once #include <bdn/ui/View.h> namespace bdn { namespace detail { VIEW_CORE_REGISTRY_DECLARATION ( ExampleButtonView ) } class ExampleButtonView : public ui :: View { public : Property < std :: string > label ; public : ExampleButtonView ( std :: shared_ptr < ViewCoreFactory > viewCoreFactory = nullptr ); public : Notifier < const ClickEvent &> _onClick ; WeakCallback < void () >:: Receiver _clickCallbackReceiver ; public : class Core { public : Property < std :: string > label ; public : WeakCallback < void () > _clickCallback ; }; }; } Finally, connect it to the WeakCallback : void ExampleButtonView :: bindViewCore () { _clickCallbackReceiver = buttonCore -> _clickCallback . set ([ = ](){ ClickEvent evt ( shared_from_this ()); _onClick . notify ( evt ); }); } ExampleButtonView.cpp #include <bdn/ExampleButtonView.h> namespace bdn { namespace detail { VIEW_CORE_REGISTRY_IMPLEMENTATION ( ExampleButtonView ) } ExampleButtonView :: ExampleButtonView ( std :: shared_ptr < ViewCoreFactory > viewCoreFactory ) : View ( viewCoreFactory ) { bdn :: detail :: VIEW_CORE_REGISTER ( ExampleButtonView , View :: viewCoreFactory ()); } void ExampleButtonView :: bindViewCore () { View :: bindViewCore (); auto buttonCore = core < ExampleButtonView :: Core > (); buttonCore -> label . bind ( label ); _clickCallbackReceiver = buttonCore -> _clickCallback . set ([ = ](){ ClickEvent evt ( shared_from_this ()); _onClick . notify ( evt ); }); } } Congratulations, your first custom view should be working now!","title":"Writing a New View"},{"location":"guides/extending/writing_view/#writing-a-new-view","text":"","title":"Writing a New View"},{"location":"guides/extending/writing_view/#introduction","text":"This guide will use the Button class implementation as an example to demonstrate the steps needed to extend the Boden Framework with new view components.

A property represents a public value of arbitrary type that can be observed by notification listeners and bound to other properties using a built-in data binding mechanism . This is useful especially for user interface code as data is commonly shared between multiple widgets and other class instances like view models. Properties also make it easy to expose a read-only version of a data member publicly and keep write access private. They can be extended with getter and setter functions transparently and they come with support for the auto keyword and std::optional . Exposing Properties \u00b6 Properties are intended to be exposed as public data members of a class: using namespace bdn ; class Circle { public : Property < double > radius ; }; // Usage Circle circle ; circle . radius = 10. ; double radius = circle . radius ; // value will be 10. Initializing Property Values \u00b6 Properties can be initialized in the member initialization list of a class: using namespace bdn ; class Circle { public : Property < double > radius = 10. ; }; Alternatively, a property's value can also be initialzed in the constructor of a class: using namespace bdn ; class Circle { public : Circle () : radius ( 10. ) {} private : Property < double > radius ; }; Data Bindings \u00b6 Two property values can easily be synchronized by setting up a binding: using namespace bdn ; using namespace bdn :: ui ; class ViewModel { public : Property < std :: string > buttonText = \"Hello world!\" ; }; class MainViewController : public Base { public : MainViewController ( ViewModel * viewModel ) { // Create the button _button = std :: make_shared < Button > (); // Update the button's label when the buttonText property of // ViewModel changes button -> label . bind ( viewModel -> buttonText ); // [...] } private : std :: shared_ptr < Button > _button ; }; The bind() method sets up a bidirectional (or two-way) data binding by default. That is, regardless of whether you change the value of viewModel->buttonText or button->label , the other property will automatically be updated to the new value. You can also set up a unidirectional (or one-way) data binding: button -> label . bind ( viewModel -> buttonText , BindMode :: unidirectional ); In this case, viewModel->buttonText will be updated when changing button->label , but not the other way around. Note Data bindings update the values of bound properties synchronously. You should use bind() only when working with properties on the same thread. See Thread-Safety for more information. Change Notifications \u00b6 Properties can notify observers when their value changes. Observers can register for receiving notifications using the onChange() method: Property < std :: string > name ; name . onChange () += []( auto property ) { std :: cout << property . get () << std :: endl ; } onChange() returns a Notifier object which can be used to subscribe or unsubscribe notification handler functions. Read-Only Access \u00b6 If you want to provide users of your class with read access to certain properties only, you can declare Property private and provide a public const Property reference: using namespace bdn ; class Circle { public : Circle ( double initRadius ) : _radius ( initRadius ) {} // Property accessible for reading only from the outside const Property < double >& radius = _radius ; private : // Property accessible for reading and writing from inside the Circle class Property < double > _radius ; } Getters and Setters \u00b6 You can implement custom getter and/or setter functions and Property will call them when its value is updated or retrieved: using namespace bdn ; class Person { public : Property < std :: string > name = { GetterSetter < std :: string > { // Pointer to the instance which provides the getter/setter this , // Pointer to getter member function & Person :: name , // Pointer to setter member function & person :: setName , // Pointer to data member storing name's value & _name } }; std :: string name () const { return _name ; } // Besides setting the property value, setters must return // a bool indicating whether the property's value has been // changed by the set operation bool setName ( const std :: string & name ) { if ( name != _name ) { _name = name ; return true ; // value did change } return false ; // value did not change } private : std :: string _name ; }; While the example above contains both a getter and a setter, it is also OK to provide only a getter with no setter and no member pointer. In that case the property is runtime read-only and an exception is thrown when you try to call its setter. If no getter is provided, a member pointer must be given. If neither getter nor setter are specified, Property will automatically substitute both functions with a default implementation. Note Using Property makes it easier for you to refactor your application when you need to use custom getter or setter logic instead of the default implementation. You can add a getter and/or setter to your Property instance without having to change the code using your property. Please also note that getters return a copy of the property's data. Hence, you cannot write to non-primitive value types returned from a getter. See Non-Primitive Value Types for details. auto Keyword \u00b6 Properties support the C++11 auto keyword. However, you have to dereference a property using the * operator when using auto : using namespace bdn ; Property < std :: string > nameProperty = \"John\" ; auto name = nameProperty ; // Error: copy constructor is explicitly deleted auto name = * nameProperty ; // type of name will be deduced to std::string Alternatively, get() can be used when working with auto : using namespace bdn ; Property < std :: string > nameProperty = \"John\" ; auto name = nameProperty . get (); Non-Primitive Value Types \u00b6 Properties support non-primitive value types such as user-defined classes and structs. Members can be read using the arrow operator: using namespace bdn ; struct Person { std :: string name = \"John\" ; int age = 30 ; }; Property < Person > person ; std :: string name = person -> name ; int age = person -> age ; Writing to a member of a non-primitive type inside a property is not supported since property getters return copies of the property's value: using namespace bdn ; Property < Person > person ; person -> name = \"Jack\" ; // Error: no viable overloaded = If you want to write to a property holding a non-primitive type, use get() and set() to copy and modify the property's value: using namespace bdn ; Property < Person > personProperty ; Person person = personProperty . get (); person . name = \"Jack\" ; personProperty . set ( person ); Pointer Types \u00b6 Pointer types, including smart pointers, are supported by the Property class. Consider the following example: using namespace bdn ; class Model : public Base { public : Property < std :: string > labelText ; }; class ViewModel : public Base { public : Property < std :: shared_ptr < Model >> model ; }; std :: shared_ptr < ViewModel > viewModel = std :: make_shared < ViewModel > (); // Do something with the view model When using pointer types, Property 's arrow operator can be used to write to nested properties: std :: shared_ptr < ViewModel > viewModel = std :: make_shared < ViewModel > (); viewModel -> model -> labelText = \"Hello world!\" ; Copying \u00b6 Property is not copy constructible, but property values can be copied by default constructing a Property instance and then assigning another property's value using operator = : using namespace bdn ; Property < std :: string > name ; Property < std :: string > badNameCopy = name ; // Error: copy constructor // is explicitly deleted Property < std :: string > goodNameCopy ; goodNameCopy = name ; // OK: value of name is copied to value // of goodNameCopy by assignment Consequently, structs or classes containing Property data members are also not copy constructible: using namespace bdn ; struct Person { Property < std :: string > name = \"John\" ; }; Person person ; Person person2 = person ; // Error: copy constructor of Person // is implicitly deleted If your struct or class needs to be copy constructible, you may implement a custom copy constructor: using namespace bdn ; struct Person { Person () = default ; Person ( const Person & other ) : Person () { name = other . name ; // OK: assignment after default construction } Property < std :: string > name = \"John\" ; }; Person person ; Person person2 = person ; // OK: copy constructor of name // data member is never called Thread-Safety \u00b6 Property is currently not thread-safe. If you want to work with properties from multiple threads, make a copy of the respective property object's data and then use that copy on your worker thread. Do not read a single Property instance's value among different threads as this may cause undefined behavior. If you need to write to a property instance from more than one thread, use DispatchQueue to queue a property value change on the thread the property is being read on. Writing to a single property instance from multiple threads simultaneously may result in undefined behavior. Do not use bind() to set up a data binding with properties that are accessed from different threads. Doing so may also result in undefined behavior. Note If you find that you need to frequently read/write to properties from multiple threads, consider using a plain data member or std::shared_ptr instead of Property . Also, you might want to rearchitect your design to not use multiple threads operating directly on the user interface as this can lead to very complex code without a real benefit. As a rule of thumb, implement all UI logic on one thread and offload CPU intensive work to worker threads operating on data only. Copy data instead of sharing it between the UI thread and workers. Use DispatchQueue to update the UI. Keep your design simple. Further Reading \u00b6 To see the use of Property in a real application example, please refer to our TodoMVC Tutorial on Medium .

The way these are embedded into the build process and the specific capabilities of these mechanisms vary quite a bit though. As an example let's compare the iOS and Androids resource system. iOS \u00b6 Example folder structure: iOS .app bundles contain a Resources folder that is meant to host the applications binary data. Inside you can create subfolders with the extension .lproj that can host different versions of a file for different languages ( e.g. de.lrpoj or en-US.lproj ). The special base.lproj is used the specify the default such that files not found in a specific language bundle will be looked up in it. The directory structure inside these can be defined by the user arbitrarily. Android \u00b6 Example folder structure: Android on the other hand follows a different approach. It defines a rigid structure per type of resource. An image, for instance, needs to be in a folder called res/drawables while a json file might be stored in res/raw . To specify the language ( and other selections like e.g. the dpi etc. ) you add this information to the folder name: res/drawables-hidpi-en-US . Users cannot create subfolders inside these folders. Trying to do so may result in compile errors, and the files are simply not accessible. Android has another mechanism for distributing files with the application called assets . The asset folders structure can be defined by users and it can house any type of data. However, a downside is that its content cannot be automatically localized.

Trying to do so may result in compile errors, and the files are simply not accessible. Android has another mechanism for distributing files with the application called assets .

KG (\u201cAshampoo Systems\u201d or \u201cWe\u201d) would like to inform the visitors and users of our web pages and services about how we process their personal data and about the purpose, the nature and the scope of such processing. The entity responsible for data processing on our websites or in connection with our services within the meaning of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is Ashampoo Systems GmbH & Co. KG, Felix-Wankel-Str. 16, 26125 Oldenburg, Germany. Our web pages and services \u00b6 Since our web pages and services evolve constantly, this data protection information changes from time to time. In particular, this applies to the methods we use to analyse website usage and measure the effectiveness of advertising methods as well as to comparable services, especially services by third-party providers. For the current status, see the table below. Regarding our use of service providers outside the European Union: We provide different services for users around the world. We generally prefer using service providers based in the EU for specific services if they can provide the same quality and similar pricing. Many services we use are either not currently available from EU-based providers or the existing providers do not offer acceptable alternatives. For this reason, we use a number of service providers based outside the European Union. We take care to ensure that everything is done to achieve an appropriate level of protection of data according to European and national privacy regulations. Use of personal data \u00b6 We collect, process and use personal information to provide our services. This includes advertising our products and informing individuals who are interested in or already use our services about the features available. The scope of processing personal data primarily depends on whether a user simply visits one of our websites, uses them as a registered user or is just registering. Children\u2019s privacy \u00b6 Our websites are publicly accessible and not designed for children. We do not knowingly collect data from users who are considered minors under their national legislation. What information do we collect when you visit our website? \u00b6 When you visit our website, your online behaviour may be evaluated statistically. This is primarily done using cookies and so-called web analytics. Your online behaviour is typically analysed anonymously; it will not be traced back to you. We process your data according to Art. 6 (1) (f) of the GDPR based on our legitimate interest in improving the stability and functionality of our website. Cookies \u00b6 We use cookies on our web pages. Cookies are small text files that can be stored and read on your device. There are session cookies, which are deleted as soon as you close your web browser, and permanent cookies which remain stored even after the session is over. Cookies can contain data which allow a device to be recognised. In some cases, cookies only contain information on certain settings which are not connected with an individual. On our websites, we use session cookies and permanent cookies. We process your data based on Art. 6 (1) S. 1 (f) of the GDPR in order to enable user guidance, improve the user experience and adapt how our website is displayed to you. You can configure your web browser to inform you about cookies when they are stored on your device. This makes the use of cookies transparent to you. In addition, you can delete cookies using the corresponding browser command and prevent new cookies from being stored on your system. Please note that our web pages may not display properly in this case and some features may be unavailable. User data and log files \u00b6 When you visit our websites, so-called usage data records are temporarily stored on our web server for statistical purposes in order to improve the quality of our websites. These records consist of the following: the page from which you requested the file the name of the file the date and time of the request the amount of data transferred the access status (file transferred, file not found) the description of the type of web browser used the IP address of the requesting computer, which is truncated to ensure that it cannot be linked to a person This log data is stored anonymously. We only store this information for no more than seven days for the purpose of detecting, narrowing down and eliminating attacks on our websites. After this period, we delete this information. The legal basis of this activity is Art. 6 (1) S. 1 (f) of the GDPR. Web analytics services \u00b6 Based on our legitimate interest (i.e. interest in analysing, optimising and running our online offering within the meaning of Art. 6 (1) S. 1 (f) of the GDPR, we use the following web analytics tools: Google Analytics \u00b6 To ensure the best possible user experience, we create anonymous usage profiles using Google Analytics. Google Analytics uses cookies which are stored on your device and which we can read. This allows us to recognise and count returning visitors anonymously. We process your data based on Art. 6 (1) S. 1 (f) of the GDPR or Section 15 (3) of the German telemedia act in order to determine how often different users access our web pages. The information the cookie generates on your use of this website is usually sent to a Google server in the USA and saved there. However, because we have enabled IP anonymisation on this website, Google will first truncate your IP address in European Union Member States. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be sent to and shortened by Google servers in the USA. According to Art. 45 para. 1 of the GDPR, an appropriate level of data protection exists due to Google\u2019s participation in the Privacy Shield. In addition, we have entered into an agreement with Google LLC (USA) regarding data processing on our behalf pursuant to Art. 28 of the GDPR. Under this agreement, Google will only use this information for evaluating how visitors use our website and compiling reports on website activities. You can object to this processing at any time by using one of the following methods: You may prevent the installation of cookies by adjusting the settings of your browser; however, if you do so, you may be unable to use all features of this website. Additionally, you can prevent the transfer to Google of the data generated by the cookie and relating to your use of the website (including your IP address) and prevent Google from processing this data by downloading and installing the browser plugin available here. You will find the privacy statement, contact details and further information on Google Analytics in the list of our subcontractors below. Advertising (remarketing, conversion tracking) \u00b6 Based on our legitimate interest, i.e. our interest in marketing our website optimally and analysing user behaviour in order to optimise our website as well as our advertising, and based on the express consent of the page visitor where required, we use the following online marketing services on our websites: Google Remarketing \u00b6 We use Google\u2019s cross-device remarketing technologies to allow other websites to show you targeted advertising based on your visit to our websites. We process your data based on Art. 6 (1) S. 1 (f) of the GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in analysing user behaviour in order to optimise both their website and their advertising. When you visit our websites, it is possible for Google\u2019s cross-device remarketing technologies to retrieve identifiers of the web browser you use (e.g. by creating a so-called browser fingerprint), evaluate your IP address or store identifiers (small text files, e.g. third-party cookies) on your device. Google may also link your visit to our websites to one or several of these identifiers as well as store this information to show you our advertisements on other websites. The identifiers described above are designed as pseudonyms. We can ask Google to use its cross-device remarketing technologies to show you advertising on other websites based on the pages you visit on our websites. So if you visit a site that participates in Google\u2019s display advertising network, Google can use the identifiers to determine if and what advertising should be displayed to you. For more information about how Google remarketing technologies work, see https://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/. If you log in to Google services using your own login credentials or use one or more Google accounts of your own, Google may link the identifiers of different web browsers or devices with each other. So if Google has created separate identifiers for your laptop, desktop, smartphone or tablet PC, these identifiers can be associated with one another as soon as you access a Google service using your login credentials. This allows Google to target our advertising campaigns beyond individual devices. However, Google will only do this if you have given Google your consent to process your information in this way in the past. You can adjust your settings to control advertising. You can object to this type of advertising at any time. To disable personalised advertising, visit https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922. Please note that these settings may not work for all devices or web browsers. For a privacy statement, contact details and further information on Google, see the list of our subcontractors below. Google Ads and Google Conversion Tracking \u00b6 We use Google Ads. Google Ads is an online advertising program provided by Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States (\u201cGoogle\u201d). As part of Google Ads, we use conversion tracking. When you click on an ad served by Google, a conversion tracking cookie will be set. Cookies are small text files that web browsers store on the user\u2019s computer. These cookies expire after 30 days and are not used to identify users. When a user visits certain pages of this website while the cookie is still active, Google (and we) can see that the user has clicked on the ad and was forwarded to this page. Each organisation using Google Ads receives a different cookie. The cookies cannot be tracked via the websites of these organisations. The information obtained by means of conversion cookies is used to create conversion statistics for Google Ads customers using conversion tracking. Customers are informed of the total number of users who have clicked on their ads and were forwarded to a page with a conversion tracking tag. However, they do not receive information which can be used to identify users personally. If you do not wish to participate in tracking, you can object to this use by disabling the conversion tracking cookie in the user settings of your web browser. You will then not be included in the conversion tracking statistics. Conversion cookies are stored and this tracking tool is used under Art. 6 (1) (f) of the GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in analysing user behaviour in order to optimise both their website and their advertising. For more information about Google Ads and Google Conversion Tracking, see the Google Privacy Policy. You can configure your browser so that it informs you when cookies are installed and only permits them individually, blocks cookies on a case-by-case basis or generally, or automatically deletes them when you close your web browser. The functionality of this website may be reduced if cookies are disabled. For a privacy statement, contact details and further information on Google Ads, see the list of our subcontractors below. Bing Universal Event Tracking (UET) \u00b6 The Boden and Ashampoo Systems websites use Bing Ads technology to collect and store data that is used to create usage profiles using pseudonyms. This service enables us to track user activity on our website when it has reached our website via advertisements from Bing Ads. If the page visitor reaches our website via such an ad, a cookie is set on their computer. On our website a Bing UET tag is integrated. This is a code used to store some non-personally identifiable information about the use of the website in connection with the cookie. This includes, among other things, the length of time spent on the website, which areas of the website were accessed, and which advertisements have reached the website. Information on the identity of the respective site visitor, as well as forms for entering personal data are not recorded. The collected information is transmitted to Microsoft servers in the USA and stored there for a maximum of 180 days. The collection of the data generated by the cookie and related to the use of the website as well as the processing of this data can be prevented by deactivating the setting of cookies by the site visitor in their browser. In addition, based on the user\u2019s preferences Microsoft may be able to track usage behaviour across multiple electronic devices through cross-device tracking, enabling it to display personalised advertising on or in Microsoft websites and apps. This behaviour can be disabled by the site visitor at https://choice.microsoft.com/en-us/opt-out. For more information on Bing analytics services, visit the Bing Ads website. For more information about privacy at Microsoft and Bing, see the Microsoft Privacy Policy. Newsletter \u00b6 Below, we describe the content of our newsletters as well as the procedure for opting in, the delivery process, the statistical evaluation process and your right to object. By subscribing to our newsletter, you agree to receive it and you accept the procedures described above. Content of the newsletter \u00b6 We only dispatch newsletters, e-mails or other electronic notifications containing advertising (referenced as \u201cnewsletter\u201d below) with the consent of the recipient or based on legal authorisation. If the user receives a specific description of the contents of the newsletter when subscribing, their consent applies to such contents. Otherwise, our newsletters contain information on our products, offers, promotions and our company. Double opt-in and logging \u00b6 We use a double opt-in process when you subscribe to our newsletter. This means you receive an e-mail asking you to confirm your subscription. This confirmation is necessary to ensure no one subscribes with someone else\u2019s e-mail address. Subscriptions to our newsletter are logged to allow us to provide evidence of subscriptions in accordance with regulations. This includes storing the time of registration and confirmation as well as the IP address. Changes to the information stored by our delivery service provider are also logged. Delivery Service Provider \u00b6 Newsletters are mailed through CleverReach (CleverReach GmbH & Co. KG, M\u00fchlenstr. 43, 26180 Rastede, Germany), our delivery service provider. For a privacy statement, contact details and further information on the delivery service provider, see the list of our subcontractors below. The delivery service provider can also use data to improve its own services in anonymous form (i.e. without connecting the data to users), e.g. for technically improving its dispatch processes or how it displays the newsletters or for statistical purposes, e.g. for determining recipients\u2019 countries. However, the delivery service provider does not use our newsletter recipients\u2019 information to contact them itself or pass data on to third parties. Subscription information \u00b6 To subscribe to our newsletter, your e-mail address is sufficient. Optionally, you can specify a name so we can address you personally in the newsletter. Statistical survey/analysis \u00b6 Our newsletters include a so-called web beacon. This is a pixel-sized file which is retrieved by the delivery service provider when you open the newsletter. The beacon enables us to collect technical information, e.g. on your web browser and your system, as well as your IP address and the time of the beacon retrieval. This information is used to improve our services based on the technical information or the target groups and their viewing behaviour in connection with the places of retrieval (which can be determined using the IP address) or the times of access. The statistical information collected also includes whether the newsletters were opened, when they were opened and what links were clicked. While it is technically possible to associate this information with individual newsletter recipients, neither we nor our delivery service provider are interested in monitoring individual users. Instead, we use this information to understand the viewing habits of our users and adapt our content accordingly or to send different content according to our users\u2019 interests. Our use of a delivery service provider, our statistical evaluation/analysis and our logging of the registration process is based on our legitimate interests according to Art. 6 (1) (f) of the GDPR. We are interested in providing a user-friendly, secure newsletter system that serves our business interests while meeting users\u2019 expectations. Termination/cancellation \u00b6 You can unsubscribe from our newsletter at any time by revoking your consent. This simultaneously cancels your consent to its delivery via the delivery service provider and your consent to the statistical surveys. We regret that it is not possible to separately cancel the delivery by the delivery service provider and the statistical survey. You can find an Unsubscribe link at the bottom of each newsletter. Tools \u00b6 We use a number of Google tools to enhance the functionality of our website. Google Tag Manager \u00b6 We use Google Tag Manager. Google Tag Manager is a solution marketers use to manage website tags. Google Tag Manager itself (the tool that implements the tags) is a cookie-free domain that does not collect personal data. The tool triggers other tags which may collect data. Google Tag Manager does not access this data. For a privacy statement, contact details and further information on Google Tag Manager, see the list of our subcontractors below. Google reCAPTCHA \u00b6 We use Google reCAPTCHA (referred to as \u201creCAPTCHA\u201d below) on our websites. This service is offered by Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA (\u201cGoogle\u201d). reCAPTCHA is designed to check whether data is entered on our websites by a human or by automated software, e.g. in a contact form. To determine this, reCAPTCHA analyses the website visitor\u2019s behaviour using different characteristics. This analysis starts automatically as soon as the visitor opens the website. reCAPTCHA evaluates different information such as IP addresses, the time the visitor spends on the website, and mouse actions. The data collected is forwarded to Google. reCAPTCHA evaluations run entirely in the background. Website visitors are not notified of the evaluation. We process your data based on Art. 6 (1) (f) of the GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in protecting its web offerings from automated spying or spam. For a privacy statement, contact details and further information on Google reCAPTCHA, see the list of our subcontractors below. YouTube videos \u00b6 Our website uses the YouTube embedding function to display and play videos provided by YouTube, which is part of Google. When embedded YouTube videos are started, YouTube uses cookies to collect user behaviour information. According to information provided by YouTube, these cookies are used to collect video statistics, improve user friendliness and prevent abuse. When the site visitor is logged in to Google, data generated when clicking on a video is directly associated with their account. Page visitors who do not want videos to be associated with their accounts need to log out before clicking on a button. Google stores page visitor information as usage profiles (even for users who are not logged in) and evaluates it. This evaluation occurs under Art. 6 (1) (f) of the GDPR based on Google\u2019s legitimate interests in showing personalised advertising, carrying out market research and/or designing its website according to users\u2019 requirements. Page visitors have a right to object against these user profiles. To exercise it, they must contact YouTube. For a privacy statement, contact details and further information on YouTube, see the list of our subcontractors below. Web hosting \u00b6 We use Amazon Web Services (\u201cAWS\u201d), a service provided by Amazon Web Services Germany GmbH, Krausenstr. 38, 10117 Berlin, Germany for hosting our database and web content. This information is stored in a data centre in Frankfurt/Main, Germany, which is certified according to ISO 27001, 27017 and 2018 as well as PCI DSS Level 1. Of course, Ashampoo Systems has only limited rights of access and the data is protected against access by third parties using the latest technology. You can find the privacy statement and contact information of Amazon AWS in the list of our subcontractors below. Sending transaction e-mails \u00b6 We use Mailgun (Mailgun Technologies, Inc., 548 Market St. #43099, San Francisco, CA 94104, USA) for delivering order confirmations, notifications, invoice information, etc. We use Mailgun to ensure that our e-mail messages reach you reliably, securely and fast without being classified as spam. Mailgun is certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield which means the legal requirements for appropriate privacy levels according to Art. 45 of the GDPR are met. We have entered into an agreement with Mailgun regarding data processing on our behalf pursuant to Art. 28 of the GDPR. Under this agreement, Mailgun is obliged to protect our customers\u2019 data and not pass it on to third parties. For a privacy statement, contact details and further information on Mailgun, see the list of our subcontractors below. What information do we collect for contract purposes when you open a customer account? \u00b6 To use our services (whether free or chargeable), you must create a customer account. Below, we explain what information is stored or processed in connection with your customer account or with the execution of your contract. Creating a customer account for using our services \u00b6 If you want to use our services you will need to create a customer account.

We only store and use the personal information you transmit to us during the ordering process in accordance with Art. 6 (1) S. 1 (b) of the GDPR for processing your orders. We will use your e-mail address for sending you notifications on the status of your order or related documents. We also offer you account reports as well as news & product information by e-mail. As part of the ordering process, the information you provide us with regarding your order (name, address, account number, bank sort code, credit card number, invoice amount, currency and transaction number, if applicable) is passed on to payment service providers Stripe (Stripe Inc., 510 Townsend Street, San Francisco, CA 94103, USA, USA) and Taxamo (EVAT Solutions Ltd, trading as Taxamo, 1, Library Place, Iveragh Rd, Castleconway, Killorglin, Co. Kerry, Ireland) via an encrypted SSL or TLS connection. This information is only passed on where necessary for processing payment transactions. See the list of our subcontractors below for privacy statements and contact information of the payment service providers. What information do we collect when you communicate with us? \u00b6 When you contact us, e.g. using our contact form, or when you participate in a survey, we may process personal data.

The legal basis of processing under the contractual relationship is Art. 6 (1) S. 1 (b) of the GDPR; for all other purposes, Art. 6 (1) S. 1 (b) of the GDPR shall apply. The website operator has a legitimate interest in carrying out the exchange you initiated or processing your inquiry effectively. In this regard, we only use your data for processing your inquiry. We use the Zendesk software solution offered by Zendesk Inc., 1019 Market St, San Francisco, CA 94103, USA to process your support or contact requests. Your data will be stored and processed on servers hosted by Zendesk in the EU. We have entered into an agreement with Zendesk regarding data processing on our behalf pursuant to Art. 28 of the GDPR. Under this agreement, Zendesk is obliged to protect our customers\u2019 data and not pass it on to third parties. For a privacy statement, contact details and further information on Zendesk, see the list of our subcontractors below. Surveys \u00b6 We use the services provided by SurveyMonkey Europe UC, 2nd Floor, 2 Shelbourne Buildings, Shelbourne Road, Dublin, Ireland for carrying out surveys on our website. If you participate in this optional survey, SurveyMonkey collects information on the device and the application you use for participating. This includes the IP address, the OS version, the device type as well as information on your system and its capabilities as well as the web browser type. If you use a mobile device for participating in the survey, SurveyMonkey will also store its UUID.

For more information on the cookies used by SurveyMonkey, on privacy and on retention periods, visit https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/legal/privacy-policy/#pp-section-10. We use SurveyMonkey to offer you surveys. This purpose is also the basis of our legitimate interest to process this data according to Art. 6 (1) (f) of the GDPR. SurveyMonkey Europe UC is a subsidiary of SurveyMonkey Inc., based in the United States. We cannot exclude that your data collected by SurveyMonkey may also be transmitted to the United States. However, SurveyMonkey Inc. has agreed to abide by the Privacy Shield Agreement signed between the European Union and the United States and has obtained the appropriate certification. This means that SurveyMonkey is obliged to comply with the standards and regulations of European privacy legislation. For a privacy statement, contact details and further information on SurveyMonkey, see the list of our subcontractors below. Job applications, especially by e-mail \u00b6 We process your personal data in accordance with the applicable privacy regulations based on Section 26 of the German data protection act. We only process the information you provide to us in your (online) application for selecting applicants. This data is not processed for any other purposes. You determine the scope of the information you would like to transmit to us in your application. Applications are transmitted in encrypted form to our HR department, which will process them as quickly as possible. Normally applications are forwarded to the heads of the relevant departments. Your information will not be passed on to any other parties. Your information will be treated in confidence. If your application is not successful, your documents will be deleted after a period of 6 months. If we may use your application for other or for future job openings, please make a note of this on your application. We will then process your data in accordance with Art. 6 (1) S. 1 (a) of the GDPR. Security measures \u00b6 We take organisational, contractual and technical security measures according to the state of the art designed to ensure that privacy regulations are complied with and data we process are protected against accidental or deliberate manipulation, loss, destruction or access by unauthorised third parties. Connection security \u00b6 Our websites use encryption. The data you enter will be transmitted from your computer to our server and vice versa via the internet using TLS encryption. You can tell this from the closed lock symbol in the status bar of your browser and the https:// in the address bar. Data security \u00b6 Ashampoo Systems user data is protected by technical and organizational security measures to minimise risks due to loss, abuse, unauthorised access and unauthorised disclosure or modification. Methods we use include firewalls, data encryption and physical restrictions of access to our data centres and data access authorisation checks. Administrative access \u00b6 For purposes of customer service and to track errors, Ashampoo Systems employees may access the administrative area of our websites from time to time. This means they can access all areas of a website, including password-protected areas. All of our employees are made aware of privacy issues and are obliged to comply with privacy and data protection regulations. Duration of storage of personal data \u00b6 The data we process is deleted or processing is restricted in accordance with Articles 17 and 18 of the GDPR. Unless stated otherwise in this privacy statement, the data we store is deleted as soon as it is no longer required for its intended purpose and no statutory retention periods prevent it from being deleted and/or we have no legitimate interest in retaining it. If data is not deleted because it is required for other, legally permissible purposes, we restrict its processing, i.e. the data is blocked and cannot be processed for other purposes. For example, this applies to data which must be retained for commercial or for tax reasons. According to legal requirements in Germany, retention periods are 6 years pursuant to Section 257 (1) of the German Commercial Code (trading books, inventories, opening balance sheets, annual accounts, trade letters, accounting documents, etc.) and 10 years in accordance with Section 147 Abs. 1 AO (books, records, management reports, accounting documents, commercial and business letters, documents relevant for taxation, etc.). Rights of the data subjects \u00b6 Regarding the processing of your personal data, website visitors have certain rights under the GDPR: Right of access to information (Art. 15 GDPR) \u00b6 You are entitled to a confirmation as to whether your personal data is processed. If this is the case, you have a right to be informed about the nature of this personal data and the information listed in Article 15 of the GDPR. Right to rectification and deletion (Articles 16 and 17 of the GDPR) \u00b6 You have the right to request that incorrect personal data regarding you is corrected immediately or incomplete personal data is completed, as the case may be. In addition, you have the right to request that personal data regarding you is immediately deleted if one of the reasons stated in Art. 17 of the GDPR applies, e.g. if the data is no longer required for the purposes for which it was collected. Right to restriction of processing (Art. 18 of the GDPR) \u00b6 You have the right to request that processing is restricted if one of the prerequisites stated in Art. 18 of the GDPR applies, e.g. if you objected to processing, for the duration of a possible examination. Right to data portability (Art. 20 of the GDPR) \u00b6 In specific cases stated in Art. 20 of the GDPR, you have the right to obtain the personal data regarding you in a structured, common and machine-readable format or request that this data be transmitted to a third party. Right to object (Art. 21 GDPR) \u00b6 If data is collected based on Article 6 (1) S. 1 (f) (processing is required for the purposes of legitimate interests), you have the right to object to the processing at any time for reasons arising from your particular situation. We will then no longer process your personal data unless there are demonstrably compelling reasons that outweigh the interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject, or the processing serves to assert, exercise or defend legal claims. Right to appeal to a supervisory authority \u00b6 According to Art. 77 of the GDPR, you have the right to appeal to a supervisory authority if you consider the processing of personal data relating to you as a breach of data protection regulations. The right of appeal may be exercised in particular before a supervisory authority in the member state of your residence, your place of work or the place where the alleged infringement occurred. Changes to our privacy statement \u00b6 We reserve the right to amend this privacy statement from time to time to ensure it meets current statutory requirements or to ensure it reflects changes to our services, including the introduction of new services. The latest version of our privacy statement shall always be applicable. Contact \u00b6 Your trust is important to us.

We process your data based on Art. 6 (1) S. 1 (f) of the GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in analysing user behaviour in order to optimise both their website and their advertising. When you visit our websites, it is possible for Google\u2019s cross-device remarketing technologies to retrieve identifiers of the web browser you use (e.g. by creating a so-called browser fingerprint), evaluate your IP address or store identifiers (small text files, e.g. third-party cookies) on your device. Google may also link your visit to our websites to one or several of these identifiers as well as store this information to show you our advertisements on other websites. The identifiers described above are designed as pseudonyms. We can ask Google to use its cross-device remarketing technologies to show you advertising on other websites based on the pages you visit on our websites. So if you visit a site that participates in Google\u2019s display advertising network, Google can use the identifiers to determine if and what advertising should be displayed to you. For more information about how Google remarketing technologies work, see https://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/. If you log in to Google services using your own login credentials or use one or more Google accounts of your own, Google may link the identifiers of different web browsers or devices with each other. So if Google has created separate identifiers for your laptop, desktop, smartphone or tablet PC, these identifiers can be associated with one another as soon as you access a Google service using your login credentials. This allows Google to target our advertising campaigns beyond individual devices. However, Google will only do this if you have given Google your consent to process your information in this way in the past. You can adjust your settings to control advertising. You can object to this type of advertising at any time. To disable personalised advertising, visit https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922.

PREAMBLE \u00b6 The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other functional and useful document \"free\" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others. This License is a kind of \"copyleft\", which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software. We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference. 1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS \u00b6 This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The \"Document\", below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as \"you\". You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law. A \"Modified Version\" of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language. A \"Secondary Section\" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them. The \"Invariant Sections\" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none. The \"Cover Texts\" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words. A \"Transparent\" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not \"Transparent\" is called \"Opaque\". Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only. The \"Title Page\" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, \"Title Page\" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text. The \"publisher\" means any person or entity that distributes copies of the Document to the public. A section \"Entitled XYZ\" means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as \"Acknowledgements\", \"Dedications\", \"Endorsements\", or \"History\".) To \"Preserve the Title\" of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section \"Entitled XYZ\" according to this definition. The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License. 2. VERBATIM COPYING \u00b6 You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3. You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies. 3. COPYING IN QUANTITY \u00b6 If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects. If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages. If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public. It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document. 4. MODIFICATIONS \u00b6 You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version: A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission. B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement. C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher. D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document. E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices. F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below. G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice. H. Include an unaltered copy of this License. I. Preserve the section Entitled \"History\", Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled \"History\" in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence. J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the \"History\" section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission. K. For any section Entitled \"Acknowledgements\" or \"Dedications\", Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein. L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles. M. Delete any section Entitled \"Endorsements\". Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version. N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled \"Endorsements\" or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section. O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers. If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles. You may add a section Entitled \"Endorsements\", provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties\u2014for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard. You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one. The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version. 5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS \u00b6 You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers. The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work. In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled \"History\" in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled \"History\"; likewise combine any sections Entitled \"Acknowledgements\", and any sections Entitled \"Dedications\". You must delete all sections Entitled \"Endorsements\". 6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS \u00b6 You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects. You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document. 7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS \u00b6 A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document. If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate. 8. TRANSLATION \u00b6 Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English version of this License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail. If a section in the Document is Entitled \"Acknowledgements\", \"Dedications\", or \"History\", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title. 9. TERMINATION \u00b6 You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation. Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice. Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does not give you any rights to use it. 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE \u00b6 The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See https://www.gnu.org/licenses/ . Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Document. 11. RELICENSING \u00b6 \"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site\" (or \"MMC Site\") means any World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works. A public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server. A \"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration\" (or \"MMC\") contained in the site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site. \"CC-BY-SA\" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco, California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license published by that same organization. \"Incorporate\" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in part, as part of another Document. An MMC is \"eligible for relicensing\" if it is licensed under this License, and if all works that were first published under this License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008. The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.","title":"FDL 1.3"},{"location":"legal/licensing/fdl-1.3/#gnu-free-documentation-license","text":"Version 1.3, 3 November 2008 Copyright (C) 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc. https://fsf.org/ Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.","title":"GNU Free Documentation License"},{"location":"legal/licensing/fdl-1.3/#0-preamble","text":"The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other functional and useful document \"free\" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.

This License is a kind of \"copyleft\", which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software.

But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.","title":"0. PREAMBLE"},{"location":"legal/licensing/fdl-1.3/#1-applicability-and-definitions","text":"This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The \"Document\", below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as \"you\". You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law. A \"Modified Version\" of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language. A \"Secondary Section\" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them. The \"Invariant Sections\" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none. The \"Cover Texts\" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words. A \"Transparent\" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not \"Transparent\" is called \"Opaque\". Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only. The \"Title Page\" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, \"Title Page\" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text. The \"publisher\" means any person or entity that distributes copies of the Document to the public. A section \"Entitled XYZ\" means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as \"Acknowledgements\", \"Dedications\", \"Endorsements\", or \"History\".) To \"Preserve the Title\" of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section \"Entitled XYZ\" according to this definition. The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License.","title":"1.

You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.

Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects. If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages. If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version: A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission. B.

Preamble \u00b6 The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too. When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things. To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it. For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software. Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations. Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all. The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION \u00b6 0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The \"Program\", below, refers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term \"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as \"you\". Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does. 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program. You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change. b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License. c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.) These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program. In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License. 3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following: a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.) The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable. If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code. 4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. 5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it. 6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License. 7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program. If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice. This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License. 8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License. 9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. 10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally. NO WARRANTY 11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.","title":"GPL 2"},{"location":"legal/licensing/gpl-2/#gnu-general-public-license","text":"Version 2, June 1991 Copyright ( C ) 1989 , 1991 Free Software Foundation , Inc . 51 Franklin Street , Fifth Floor , Boston , MA 02110 - 1301 , USA Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document , but changing it is not allowed .","title":"GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE"},{"location":"legal/licensing/gpl-2/#preamble","text":"The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too. When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things. To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it. For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software. Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations. Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all. The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.","title":"Preamble"},{"location":"legal/licensing/gpl-2/#terms-and-conditions-for-copying-distribution-and-modification","text":"0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The \"Program\", below, refers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term \"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as \"you\". Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does. 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program. You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change. b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License. c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.) These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program. In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License. 3.

Preamble \u00b6 The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works. The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too. When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things. To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others. For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it. For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions. Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users. Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free. The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. TERMS AND CONDITIONS \u00b6 0. Definitions. \u00b6 \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License. \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks. \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as \"you\". \"Licensees\" and \"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations. To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the earlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work. A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program. To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well. To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying. An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\" to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion. 1. Source Code. \u00b6 The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. \"Object code\" means any non-source form of a work. A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language. The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A \"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it. The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work. The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source. The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work. 2. Basic Permissions. \u00b6 All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law. You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you. Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary. 3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law. \u00b6 No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures. When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures. 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies. \u00b6 You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program. You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee. 5. Conveying Modified Source Versions. \u00b6 You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date. b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to \"keep intact all notices\". c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it. d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so. A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate. 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms. \u00b6 You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways: a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange. b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge. c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b. d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements. e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d. A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work. A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product. \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made. If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM). The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network. Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying. 7. Additional Terms. \u00b6 \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions. When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission. Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms: a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors. All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further restrictions\" within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying. If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms. Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way. 8. Termination. \u00b6 You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11). However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation. Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice. Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10. 9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies. \u00b6 You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so. 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients. \u00b6 Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License. An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts. You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it. 11. Patents. \u00b6 A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\". A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License. Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version. In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To \"grant\" such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party. If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. \"Knowingly relying\" means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid. If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it. A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007. Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law. 12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom. \u00b6 If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program. 13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License. \u00b6 Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such. 14. Revised Versions of this License. \u00b6 The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program. Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version. 15. Disclaimer of Warranty. \u00b6 THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 16. Limitation of Liability. \u00b6 IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16. \u00b6 If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.","title":"GPL 3"},{"location":"legal/licensing/gpl-3/#gnu-general-public-license","text":"Version 3, 29 June 2007 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. https://fsf.org/ Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.","title":"GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE"},{"location":"legal/licensing/gpl-3/#preamble","text":"The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works. The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too. When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things. To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others. For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it. For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions. Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users. Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free. The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.","title":"Preamble"},{"location":"legal/licensing/gpl-3/#terms-and-conditions","text":"","title":"TERMS AND CONDITIONS"},{"location":"legal/licensing/gpl-3/#0-definitions","text":"\"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License. \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks. \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as \"you\". \"Licensees\" and \"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations. To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the earlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work. A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program. To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well. To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying. An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\" to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.

A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language. The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A \"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it. The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.

In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To \"grant\" such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party. If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. \"Knowingly relying\" means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid. If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it. A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

[ This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL . It also counts as the successor of the GNU Library Public License , version 2 , hence the version number 2 . 1 .] Preamble \u00b6 The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below. When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things. To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it. For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library. To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the original version, so that the original author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others. Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license. Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs. When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library. We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special circumstances. For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License. In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system. Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library. The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a \"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\". The former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order to run. TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION \u00b6 0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\"). Each licensee is addressed as \"you\". A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables. The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A \"work based on the Library\" means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term \"modification\".) \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library. Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does. 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library. You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: a) The modified work must itself be a software library. b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change. c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License. d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful. (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.) These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library. In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License. 3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices. Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy. This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library. 4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange. If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code. 5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License. However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the library\". The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables. When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law. If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.) Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself. 6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications. You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things: a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.) b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with. c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution. d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place. e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy. For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the Library\" must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable. It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute. 7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things: a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above. b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work. 8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. 9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it. 10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License. 11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library. If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice. This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License. 12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License. 13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. 14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally. NO WARRANTY 15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.","title":"LGPL 2.1"},{"location":"legal/licensing/lgpl-2.1/#gnu-lesser-general-public-license","text":"Version 2.1, February 1999 Copyright ( C ) 1991 , 1999 Free Software Foundation , Inc . 51 Franklin Street , Fifth Floor , Boston , MA 02110 - 1301 USA Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document , but changing it is not allowed .

For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License. In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system. Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library. The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a \"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\". The former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order to run.","title":"Preamble"},{"location":"legal/licensing/lgpl-2.1/#terms-and-conditions-for-copying-distribution-and-modification","text":"0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\"). Each licensee is addressed as \"you\". A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables. The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A \"work based on the Library\" means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term \"modification\".) \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library. Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does. 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library. You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: a) The modified work must itself be a software library. b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change. c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License. d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful. (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.) These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library. In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License. 3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices. Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy. This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library. 4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange. If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code. 5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License. However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the library\". The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables. When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law. If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.) Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself. 6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications. You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things: a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.) b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with. c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution. d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place. e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy. For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the Library\" must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable. It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute. 7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things: a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above. b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work. 8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. 9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it. 10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License. 11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library. If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice. This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License. 12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License. 13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. 14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally. NO WARRANTY 15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.","title":"TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION"},{"location":"legal/licensing/lgpl-3/","text":"This license makes reference to the version 3 of the GNU General Public License .

Note that on Android, the implementation of the software keyboard may override the behavior indicated by the autocorrectionType property. This property is supported on Android and iOS only. Warning On Android, this function uses the EditText widget's input type flag TYPE_TEXT_FLAG_NO_SUGGESTIONS to deactivate autocorrection, autocomplete, and typing suggestions. Based on the software keyboard implementation used by the operating system, this flag may or may not have an effect. Setting the autocorrectionType property to AutocorrectionType::No is hence not a guarantee that autocorrection will be deactivated on Android.

To accommodate for native layout updates, ios::ViewCore and all subclasses wrapping native UIView s must implement the UIViewWithFrameNotification protocol: @protocol UIViewWithFrameNotification - ( void ) setViewCore: ( std :: weak_ptr < bdn :: ios :: ViewCore > ) viewCore ; @end The ios::ViewCore constructor will call setViewCore on its native UIView instance. The UIView subclass then needs to call back the core's frameChanged method when its frame changes. For instance, this is the implementation used by ios::ButtonCore : @interface BodenUIButton : UIButton < UIViewWithFrameNotification > @property ( nonatomic , assign ) std :: weak_ptr < bdn :: ios :: ButtonCore > core ; @end @implementation BodenUIButton - ( void ) setViewCore: ( std :: weak_ptr < bdn :: ios :: ViewCore > ) viewCore { self . core = std :: dynamic_pointer_cast < bdn :: ios :: ButtonCore > ( viewCore . lock ()); } - ( void ) setFrame: ( CGRect ) frame { [ super setFrame : frame ]; if ( auto core = self . core . lock ()) { core -> frameChanged (); } } //... @end","title":"Reporting Size Changes to the Core"},{"location":"reference/ui/yoga/layout/","text":"Layout \u00b6 A Flexbox layout implementation based on Facebook's Yoga library .
